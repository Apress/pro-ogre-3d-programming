                This method allows you to change the yaw behaviour of the camera - by default, the camera
                yaws around it's own local Y axis. This is often what you want - for example a flying camera
                - but sometimes this produces unwanted effects. For example, if you're making a first-person
                shooter, you really don't want the yaw axis to reflect the local camera Y, because this would
                mean a different yaw axis if the player is looking upwards rather than when they are looking
                straight ahead. You can change this behaviour by setting the yaw to a fixed axis (say, the world Y).
            @param
                useFixed If true, the axis passed in the second parameter will always be the yaw axis no
                matter what the camera orientation. If false, the camera returns to it's default behaviour.

                fixedAxis The axis to use if the first parameter is true.

        /** Sets the Y-dimension Field Of View (FOV) of the camera.
            @remarks
                Field Of View (FOV) is the angle made between the camera's position, and the left & right edges
                of the 'screen' onto which the scene is projected. High values (90+) result in a wide-angle,
                fish-eye kind of view, low values (30-) in a stretched, telescopic kind of view. Typical values
                are between 45 and 60.
            @par
                This value represents the HORIZONTAL field-of-view. The vertical field of view is calculated from
                this depending on the dimensions of the viewport (they will only be the same if the viewport is square).

                The position of the near clipping plane is the distance from the cameras position to the screen
                on which the world is projected. The near plane distance, combined with the field-of-view and the
                aspect ratio, determines the size of the viewport through which the world is viewed (in world
                co-ordinates). Note that this world viewport is different to a screen viewport, which has it's
                dimensions expressed in pixels. The cameras viewport should have the same aspect ratio as the
                screen viewport it renders into to avoid distortion.

        /** Sets the distance to the far clipping plane.
            @remarks
                The view frustrum is a pyramid created from the camera position and the edges of the viewport.
                This frustrum does not extend to infinity - it is cropped near to the camera and there is a far
                plane beyond which nothing is displayed. This method sets the distance for the far plane. Different
                applications need different values: e.g. a flight sim needs a much further far clipping plane than
                a first-person shooter. An important point here is that the larger the gap between near and far
                clipping planes, the lower the accuracy of the Z-buffer used to depth-cue pixels. This is because the
                Z-range is limited to the size of the Z buffer (16 or 32-bit) and the max values must be spread over
                the gap between near and far clip planes. The bigger the range, the more the Z values will
                be approximated which can cause artifacts when lots of objects are close together in the Z-plane. So
                make sure you clip as close to the camera as you can - don't set a huge value for the sake of
                it.
