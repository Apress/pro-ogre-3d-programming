<p class="mainheader" align="left">Summary</p>

<p>OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a
scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it
easier and more intuitive for developers to produce games and demos
utilising 3D hardware. The class library abstracts all the details of
using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and
provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive
classes. </p>

<p>This distribution contains the precompiled SDK release of OGRE
and is the most convenient way of obtaining the engine. The full source
code is also available, for people who want a little
more flexibility or who are just curious as to the inner workings of
the engine; go to the main OGRE web page for full details.<br>

start learning OGRE. <br>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">Compiling the Samples<br>

</p>

So, how do you go about compiling the samples? Firstly you need to set
up your development environment. <br>

<br>

<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 51);"><span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">Are you using Visual C++ 6 or
Visual C++.Net 2002?</span><br>

</span>If so, you will need to use STLport, which is a
standards-compliant version of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL);
unfortunately versions of the STL which shipped with versions of Visual
C++ before .Net 2003 are not standards compliant. The OGRE project
provides a precompiled version of STLport which will work with VC6 and
VC.Net 2002; go to the downloads area to get it and install it in the
folder of your choice. After installing:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Load the Samples.dsw (VC6) or Samples.sln (VC7) file<br>

  </li>

  <li>Open Microsoft Visual C++ and select Tools | Options... from the
menu bar to bring up the options dialog</li>

  <li>Go to the include folders list: in VC6 this is on the
'Directories' tab, in VC++.Net it is under Projects|VC++ Directories in
the tree on the left</li>

  <li>Insert the directory &lt;path_to_STLport-x.x.x&gt;\stlport is at
the TOP of your include folders list. Crucially, it MUST be above all
Microsoft include folders.</li>

  <li>Insert the directory &lt;path_to_STLport-x.x.x&gt;\lib into your
library folder list.</li>

</ol>

Once you have your development environment configured, just perform a
Batch Build of the solution / workspace to build all the samples.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">Are you using Code::Blocks + MinGW + STLPort?</span><br>
If so, then you will need to follow the instructions in the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/CodeBlocks_MingW_STLPort" target="_blank">Ogre Wiki</a> for setting up Code::Blocks and MinGW prior to using the Ogre SDK.<br>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">Keeping Up To Date</p>

<p align="left">The best place to keep up to date with developments on
OGRE is the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">Official Web Site</a>.
From there you can download the latest source code and documentation.
You can choose between keeping bang up to date with CVS (Concurrent
Versioning System) or by just getting the regularly released
snapshots.</p>

<p align="left">The changes included in this current version can be
viewed on the <a href="ChangeLog.html">ChangeLog</a>. </p>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">Getting Support</p>

<p align="left">Please use our extensive forums if you need help or
think you may have found a bug. Go to the <a href="http://ogre.sf.net/">main
web site</a> and click on the Forums link.</p>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">Licensing</p>

<p>OGRE is distributed as free software under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (see <a href="License.html">License.html</a>). In
summary this means that you can use OGRE for any purpose, provided
that if you make changes to OGRE itself, you must release the changes
back into into the public domain under the LGPL and make it clear
where you have made the changes. Your own application can be
distributed under any license you like. Note that in the case of
OGRE, inlining and macros in headers are used purely for performance
or platform independence reasons, and including any of OGRE's headers
in your projects does not result in a derived work. </p>

<p>In addition, if you use Ogre it would be nice if you displayed the
Ogre logo somewhere in your application (start up or shutdown) for a
minimum of 2 seconds. This splash-screen is displayed on the standard
Ogre configuration dialog anyway, so if you use that you don't need
to do anything extra. The logo is included in the download archive as
Examples\Resources\ogrelogo.png.</p>
