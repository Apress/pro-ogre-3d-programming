                Field Of View (FOV) is the angle made between the frustum's position, and the edges

                are between 45 and 60 degrees.

                This value represents the VERTICAL field-of-view. The horizontal field of view is calculated from
                this depending on the dimensions of the viewport (they will only be the same if the viewport is square).

                on which the world is projected. The near plane distance, combined with the field-of-view and the
                aspect ratio, determines the size of the viewport through which the world is viewed (in world
                co-ordinates). Note that this world viewport is different to a screen viewport, which has it's
                dimensions expressed in pixels. The frustums viewport should have the same aspect ratio as the
                screen viewport it renders into to avoid distortion.

        /** Sets the distance to the far clipping plane.
            @remarks
                The view frustrum is a pyramid created from the frustum position and the edges of the viewport.
                This method sets the distance for the far end of that pyramid. 
                Different applications need different values: e.g. a flight sim
                needs a much further far clipping plane than a first-person 
                shooter. An important point here is that the larger the ratio 
                between near and far clipping planes, the lower the accuracy of
                the Z-buffer used to depth-cue pixels. This is because the
                Z-range is limited to the size of the Z buffer (16 or 32-bit) 
                and the max values must be spread over the gap between near and
                far clip planes. As it happens, you can affect the accuracy far 
                more by altering the near distance rather than the far distance, 
                but keep this in mind.
            @param
                far The distance to the far clipping plane from the frustum in 
                world coordinates.If you specify 0, this means an infinite view
                distance which is useful especially when projecting shadows; but
                be careful not to use a near distance too close.

		@remarks
			There are several applications for clipping a scene arbitrarily by
			a single plane; the most common is when rendering a reflection to 
			a texture, and you only want to render geometry that is above the 
			water plane (to do otherwise results in artefacts). Whilst it is
			possible to use user clip planes, they are not supported on all
			cards, and sometimes are not hardware accelerated when they are
			available. Instead, where a single clip plane is involved, this
			technique uses a 'fudging' of the near clip plane, which is 
			available and fast on all hardware, to perform as the arbitrary
			clip plane. This does change the shape of the frustum, leading 
			to some depth buffer loss of precision, but for many of the uses of
			this technique that is not an issue.
		@par 
			This version of the method links to a plane, rather than requiring
			a by-value plane definition, and therefore you can 
			make changes to the plane (e.g. by moving / rotating the node it is
			attached to) and they will automatically affect this object.
		@note This technique only works for perspective projection.
		@param plane The plane to link to to perform the clipping. This plane
			must continue to exist while the camera is linked to it; do not
			destroy it before the frustum.
