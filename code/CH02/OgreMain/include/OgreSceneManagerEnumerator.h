    /** Enumerates the SceneManager classes available to applications.
        @remarks
            As described in the SceneManager class, SceneManagers are responsible
            for organising the scene and issuing rendering commands to the
            RenderSystem. Certain scene types can benefit from different
            rendering approaches, and it is intended that subclasses will
            be created to special case this.
        @par
            In order to give applications easy access to these implementations,
            this class has a number of methods to create or retrieve a SceneManager
            which is appropriate to the scene type. 
		@par
			SceneManagers are created by SceneManagerFactory instances. New factories
			for new types of SceneManager can be registered with this class to make
			them available to clients.
		@par
			Note that you can still plug in your own custom SceneManager without
			using a factory, should you choose, it's just not as flexible that way.
			Just instantiate your own SceneManager manually and use it directly.

        into anybody who includes it. This is needed for the
        Singleton template to work, but we actually only want it

        Singleton, not all of them. If we don't change this, we get
        link errors when trying to use the Singleton-based class from
        an outside dll.
        @par
        This method just delegates to the template version anyway,
        but the implementation stays in this single compilation unit,
        preventing link errors.
