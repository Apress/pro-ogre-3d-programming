        This class is here just to allow clients to iterate over an internal
        vector of a class without having to have access to the vector itself
        (typically to iterate you need both the iterator and the end() iterator
        to test for the end condition, which is messy).
        No updates are allowed through this interface, it is purely for 
        iterating and reading.
    @par
        Note that like STL iterators, these iterators are only valid whilst no 
        updates are made to the underlying collection. You should not attempt to
        use this iterator if a change is made to the collection. In fact, treat this
        iterator as a transient object, do NOT store it and try to use it repeatedly.
