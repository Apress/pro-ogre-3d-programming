            This interface abstracts renderable discrete objects which will be queued in the render pipeline,
            grouped by material. Classes implementing this interface must be based on a single material, a single
            world matrix (or a collection of world matrices which are blended by weights), and must be 
            renderable via a single render operation.
        @par
            Note that deciding whether to put these objects in the rendering pipeline is done from the more specific
            classes e.g. entities. Only once it is decided that the specific class is to be rendered is the abstract version
            created (could be more than one per visible object) and pushed onto the rendering queue.

            This method allows a Renderable to map in a custom GPU program parameter
            based on it's own data. This is represented by a GPU auto parameter
            of ACT_CUSTOM, and to allow there to be more than one of these per
            Renderable, the 'data' field on the auto parameter will identify
            which parameter is being updated. The implementation of this method
            must identify the parameter being updated, and call a 'setConstant' 
            method on the passed in GpuProgramParameters object, using the details
            provided in the incoming auto constant setting to identify the index
            at which to set the parameter.
        @par
            You do not need to override this method if you're using the standard
            sets of data associated with the Renderable as provided by setCustomParameter
            and getCustomParameter. By default, the implementation will map from the
            value indexed by the 'constantEntry.data' parameter to a value previously
            set by setCustomParameter. But custom Renderables are free to override
            this if they want, in any case.
        @param constantEntry The auto constant entry referring to the parameter
            being updated
