    /** This class interpolates orientations (rotations) along a spline using 
        derivatives of quaternions.
    @remarks
        Like the SimpleSpline class, this class is about interpolating values 
        smoothly over a spline. Whilst SimpleSpline deals with positions (the normal
        sense we think about splines), this class interpolates orientations. The
        theory is identical, except we're now in 4-dimensional space instead of 3.
    @par
        In positional splines, we use the points and tangents on those points to generate
        control points for the spline. In this case, we use quaternions and derivatives
        of the quaternions (i.e. the rate and direction of change at each point). This is the
        same as SimpleSpline since a tangent is a derivative of a position. We effectively 
        generate an extra quaternion in between each actual quaternion which when take with 
        the original quaternion forms the 'tangent' of that quaternion.

        @remarks
            The spline calculates tangents at each point automatically based on the input points.
            Normally it does this every time a point changes. However, if you have a lot of points
            to add in one go, you probably don't want to incur this overhead and would prefer to 
            defer the calculation until you are finished setting all the points. You can do this
            by calling this method with a parameter of 'false'. Just remember to manually call 
            the recalcTangents method when you are done.
        @param autoCalc If true, tangents are calculated for you whenever a point changes. If false, 
            you must call reclacTangents to recalculate them when it best suits.

            then you must call this after completing your updates to the spline points.
