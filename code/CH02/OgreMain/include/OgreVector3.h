                A vector which is the result of the cross-product. This

                - call Vector3::normalise on the result if you wish this to
                be done. As for which side the resultant vector will be on, the

                to rkVector is anticlockwise, e.g. UNIT_Y.crossProduct(UNIT_Z)
                = UNIT_X, whilst UNIT_Z.crossProduct(UNIT_Y) = -UNIT_X.
				This is because OGRE uses a right-handed coordinate system.
