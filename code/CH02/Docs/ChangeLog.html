  <li>D3D9:&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>when loading DDS files, se&nbsp;'Ex'&nbsp;versions of DDS loading routines so that user mipmap preferences are preserved</li>
    <li>Initialise D3DTexture::mD3DPool to some value other than D3DPOOL_DEFAULT, if texture loading failed and then later it might re-create as empty texture on device lost/restore</li>

    <li>added missing shadow sampler uniform types</li>
  </ul>
  <li>TextureUnitState: Reset&nbsp;mRecalcTexMatrix to false
after&nbsp;texture matrix calculated, to avoid&nbsp;recalculating each
time</li>
  <li>Fix bootstrap script not accepting&nbsp;autoconf 2.60</li>

active and free&nbsp;list. As a side note that removing a billboard
which doesn't exist in the active list now causes assertion fault in
debug</li>
    <li>BBT_PERPENDICULAR_COMMON no need to generate axes
and&nbsp;vertex offsets for every billboards (use common axes and

  <li>Added MovableObject::getVisible allow direct access to&nbsp;the
value set by&nbsp;MovableObject::setVisible without the additional
conditions of isVisible</li>

frame and beginning of next frame - note this changes the behaviour of
AnimationStateSet::getDirtyFrameNumber, if you used this yourself,
check the changes</li>

  <li>XSI exporter: Fix a bug when submesh&nbsp;merging is enabled and
objects do not have the same geometry&nbsp;format (UV sets or vertex

image</li>

    <li>allow wave&nbsp;amplitude to be much larger now that reflections work correctly&nbsp;on waves</li>

    <li>increased mesh&nbsp;resolution so that large waves aren't so jagged</li>

  
  </ul>

    <li>readLine and skipLine now implemented in&nbsp;DataStream,
derived class doesn't need to override unless they&nbsp;have more
effective implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



    <li>Use temp buffer in the&nbsp;stack instead of in the class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



    <li>ConfigFile should open file in binary mode, since line

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v1.2.0
[Dagon] (RC1: 12 March 2006)
- Major Release</p>




1.2.0 is a new major stable release, and therefore has literally
shedloads of new features. Some interfaces have also changed since the
1.0.x branch (Azathoth), for full information on porting your
application from the previous version of OGRE, see the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/DagonNotes#Porting_notes">Dagon Porting Notes</a> in the OGRE Wiki.
<ul>






  <li><b>Compositing framework</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>






    <li>Full-screen post-processing effects made simple</li>






    <li>Easily render to multiple targets, potentially multiple times, and combine the results through shaders</li>






    <li>Chain multiple compositors together flexibly so post-processing results can be combined simply</li>






    <li>Scriptable through .compositor scripts so you can write less code</li>






    <li>Demo_Compositor shows you how to create compositors in code and through script</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>






  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple&nbsp;Render Target (MRT) support</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>






    <li>Render to multiple targets simultaneously in the same rendering operation</li>






    <li>Perform advanced effects like deferred shading (demo included)</li>






    <li>Requires a card which supports MRT</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>






  <li><b>RenderTexture enhancements</b></li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>






    <li>RenderTextures are now&nbsp;created like all other textures, with
TextureManager::getSingleton().createManual; you just need to set a usage&nbsp;parameter of
TU_RENDERTARGET</li>






    <li>Render to the faces of cube maps and to volume slices</li>






    <li>Retrieve the content of these sub-faces by accessing the
HardwarePixelBuffer like so:
tex-&gt;getBuffer(x,y)-&gt;getRenderTarget(z)</li>






    <li> RenderTarget::writeContentsToDisk now implemented for all RenderTextures</li>






    <li> D3D9: RenderTextures of compatible formats now share one DepthStencil surface to conserve memory</li>






    <li> GL: For faster and more flexible rendertextures use GL_EXT_framebuffer_object instead of pbuffers (if available)</li>






    <li> GL: PBuffers only used when rendertarget is smaller than frame buffer. If smaller, the framebuffer is used, as this is faster</li>






    <li> GL: PBuffers are shared between RenderTextures to conserve memory</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>






  <li> <b>MovableObject changes</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> All MovableObjects are now created through
MovableObjectFactory, and new factories can be registered by plugins.
Plugging in new object types generically is now simple
      </li>






      <li> SceneQueries can now exclude entire MovableObject types as well as individual objects
      </li>






      <li> Added MovableObject::setRenderingDistance which operates like
the same method of StaticGeometry, effectively limiting the view
distance of individual objects
      </li>






      <li> MovableObject::setVisibilityFlags controls the visibility of
objects based on a mask set in SceneManager::setVisibilityMask, in the
same way as SceneQuery works. This is yet another way for you to
control object visibility, and makes it simpler to turn categories of
object on / off quickly and efficiently
      </li>






      <li> The default values for MovableObject::setQueryFlags and
MovableObject::setVisibilityFlags on creation of the MovableObject are
now defined in the static methods MovableObject::setDefaultQueryFlags
and MovableObject::setDefaultVisibilityFlags. These defaults start out
at 0xFFFFFFFF to preserve previous behaviour.
      </li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li><b>Billboard / particle enhancements</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> Billboards can now be sorted individually relative to the
camera to provide correct transparency effects (also applies to
BillboardParticleRenderer, and a new 'sorted' attribute is available in
particle scripts) </li>






      <li> ParticleSystemRenderer can now describing their desired sort mode by override '_getSortMode'.
      </li>






      <li> Billboards can now have their own individual texture
coordinates to allow you to display subsets of a texture per billboard
(e.g. for billboard based text)
      </li>






      <li> Particles can now be kept in local space rather than world space
      </li>






      <li> Added two new billboard/particle type:
BBT_PERPENDICULAR_COMMON (perpendicular_common) and
BBT_PERPENDICULAR_SELF (perpendicular_self). BBT_PERPENDICULAR_COMMON
make the billboard plane perpendicular to a common direction, and
BBT_PERPENDICULAR_SELF make the billboard plane perpendicular to their
own direction. In other words, their facing to the given direction
instead of the camera. It's useful for an aureola around the player and
parallel to the ground etc. Both of them use an additional up-vector to
determine the billboard X and Y axis.
      </li>






      <li> Added billboard/particle rotation type setting, allowing you
to rotate vertices or rotate texture coordinates. Defaults to rotate
texture coordinates to preserve previous behavior. Use new
'billboard_rotation_type' attribute to set rotate type in particle
scripts when using BillboardParticleRenderer.
      </li>






      <li> Billboard particle renderer now supports setting the billboard origin in particle scripts via 'billboard_origin'.
      </li>






      <li> Particle system now allows the user to configure the sampling
interval, either fixed or based on frame-rate. Default based on
frame-rate to preserving previous behavior. Use
'ParticleSystem::setIterationInterval' to configure iteration interval
per particle system, or use
'ParticleSystem::setDefaultIterationInterval' to set the default
iteration interval for all ParticleSystem instances that don't have
their own setting. Available in script as 'iteration_interval'.
      </li>






      <li> ParticleSystem now supports a 'nonvisible update timeout'
which means that if a particle system is not visible from any camera
for the time specified, it will cease to update, saving the expense.
You can set the default for all systems without their own setting
through ParticleSystem::setDefaultNonvisibleUpdateTimeout, or set it
per system (through script as 'nonvisible_update_timeout').
      </li>






      <li> Each billboard can now have its own custom texture
coordinates instead of merely generated coordinates (which were either
the whole texture or grid set)
      </li>






      <li> Billboardset now supports an 'accurate facing' model so that
billoard orientation is calculated based on the relative positions of
the camera and each billboard, which is more accurate but slower than
the default method (which is to use the camera axes for all
billboards). This option is available through particle systems as
'accurate_facing true' too.
      </li>






      <li> BillboardChain and RibbonTrail classes allow you to do 'beam' effects like jet trails and lightning arcs
      </li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li> <b>SceneManager enhancements</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> SceneManagers are now constructed from SceneManagerFactory instances, allowing more than one instance of the same type of SM
      </li>






      <li> SceneManagers must be constructed first using
Root::createSceneManager, and can be created based on a scene type mask
(a binary combination of requested types), or an explicit name
      </li>






      <li> Available SceneManager types can be iterated over using
Root::getSceneManagerMetaDataIterator, each with a type name,
description, scene type mask and world geometry support flag
      </li>






      <li> Using multiple simultaneous SceneManagers, of the same type or different types, is now safe</li>






      <li> SceneManager::setWorldGeometry now accepts a stream as input as well as a filename</li>

  <li> <b>Material enhancements</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> Techniques, passes, and Texture unit states can now be named
      </li>






      <li> Materials can now extend other materials, through the script
syntax 'material DerivedMaterial&nbsp;: BaseMaterial', to allow simple
refinement of existing materials
      </li>






      <li> matrix4x4, float4, float9, and float16 in material script now properly load matrices for use with GLSL shader unitforms
      </li>






      <li> New auto parameter binding 'pass_number'
      </li>






      <li> Serializer now writes out all shader bindings (for tools)
      </li>

      </li>






      <li> New auto parameter binding 'pass_iteration_number'
      </li>






      <li> There is no limit on the number of frames for animated textures. There used to be a limit of 32.
      </li>






      <li> matrix4x4 in material script now uses same matrix element layout for Cg, HLSL, GLSL
      </li>






      <li> New TextureUnitState blending option, blend_diffuse_colour,
allows you to use the RGB luminence of vertex colours as an additional
blending parametric
      </li>






      <li> New texture addressing mode 'border' and texture unit
attribute 'tex_border_colour'. 'border' addressing mode will set to the
border colour when texture coordinates outside the range [0.0, 1.0].
      </li>






      <li> New gpu parameter 'render_target_flipping', allow adjust
position to accord with requires texture flipping when bypassed
standardise projection transform.

just an object basis as before)
      </li>






      <li> New feature 'material schemes' - every technique can be
allocated to a scheme ('scheme blah' in technique block), and viewports
can have a preferred scheme. This allows wholesale switching between
techniques per viewport, or just globally to do scalable effects, or
hdr paths etc
      </li>






      <li> new Ocean Demo added showing use of CEGUI manipulating programable shader parameters in realtime.
      </li>






      <li> New option on texture loading within texture_unit to load a
single-channel luminence texture into alpha, useful for fixed-function

      </li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li> <b>Animation enhancements</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Morph and Pose animation</span></li>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul>






        <li>Animation of vertex positions in either hardware or software</li>






        <li>'Morph' variant is similar to old-skool vertex keyframe
animation; this is&nbsp;recommended only for legacy applications (e.g.
MD2)</li>






        <li>'Pose' variant is a modern, blendable pose based system
which allows you to perform much more sophisticated vertex animation
such as facial animation (using expression and mouth shape keys), and
can be combined with skeletal animation.</li>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      </ul>






      <li> Existing animation tracks are now just one type of track, ie NodeAnimationTrack
      </li>






      <li> New 'NumericAnimationTrack' allows the animation of any numeric value through the AnimableValue abstraction
      </li>






      <li>Significant number of optimisations means that animation is now faster than before
      </li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li> <b>Skinning blending enhancements</b>.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li>Larger skeletons are now possible with hardware skinning.
OGRE now only passes&nbsp;world matrices for the bones of a subentity
that are
actually used, saving shader constants if you split up your mesh,
should your skeleton get too large for the constraints of the target
shader model.&nbsp;
      </li>






      <li> Software skinning is now more efficient</li>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul>






        <li>Temporary blended buffers are now held for a period of time
per entity before being released back to the pool, which allows better
frame coherency on these buffers</li>






        <li>software skinning is now done in object space,
with&nbsp;additional
special optimisations for frozen/disabled animation, so that
the&nbsp;software blended
vertex datacan be kept for as many frames as practical without
recalculating it (it will only get released when the entity has been
out of frame for some time)
        </li>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      </ul>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li> <b>ManualObject added</b> to make custom geometry creation more accessible
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> Closely mirrors the GL immediate mode interface; create geometry using begin(); position(); normal(); texCoord(); end();
      </li>






      <li> Builds data into regular hardware buffers for performance
      </li>






      <li> Supports all types of shadows
      </li>






      <li> Can convert the result to Mesh if desired for instancing
      </li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li> <b>Node&nbsp;</b><b>enhancements</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> Node::Listener added so you can use Node::setListener to get callbacks when the transform changes
      </li>






      <li> Node::setInheritOrientation/getInheritOrientation added
allows configure the node whether it should inherit orientation from
it's parent node.
      </li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li> <b>Render queue enhancements</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> Render queue groups can now be given an arbitrary uint8 identifier rather than just one of a fixed set of enums
      </li>






      <li> Custom render queue invocation sequence per viewport if required
      </li>






      <li> Allow suppression of shadow processing and render state changes during custom invocation
      </li>






      <li> Ordering / grouping of non-transparents can be changed per invocation
      </li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li> <b>Shadow enhancements</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> New shadow type SHADOWTYPE_TEXTURE_ADDITIVE, allowing the
lighting accuracy of additive shadows with the GPU speed of texture
shadows
      </li>






      <li> You can now disable the rendering of shadows per viewport, to save time in mini-maps / RTTs etc
      </li>






      <li> ShadowListener interface added
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <ul>






          <li> <i>shadowTexturesUpdated</i> allows you to hook into the time
when shadow textures have been rendered to, but before they are used.
You can use this to perform custom shadow behaviour such as filtering
          </li>






          <li> <i>shadowTextureCasterPreViewProj</i> and <i>shadowTextureReceiverPreViewProj</i>
fires before the view &amp; projection matrices are set for the shadow
caster / receiver renders respectively; you can use these hooks to
provide a specialised camera setup if you want to define custom shadow
systems
          </li>






        
        
        
        
        
        
        </ul>







      </li>






      <li> Texture shadow casting now fully supports alpha blended / alpha rejection materials
      </li>






      <li> Both stencil and texture additive shadow technique now fully supports alpha rejection shadow receiver.
      </li>






      <li> Texture shadow supports point light, used directional light
look at target mechanism and 120 degree FOV (similar spotlight)
behavior. </li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li> <b>Resource management&nbsp;</b><b>enhancements</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> Added a new predefined resource group called
ResourceGroupManager::INTERNAL_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME ("Internal") for
dealing with resources created internally by the engine; you can now
safely unload the default resource group if you choose without
affecting these internal resources.
      </li>






      <li> Added a new meta resource group called
ResourceGroupManager::AUTODETECT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME ("Autodetect"); if
you use this group name, the <i>real</i> resource group is detected at
load time based on where the resource is found in the configured
resource locations. Entity now uses this method by default to load
meshes so you no longer have to preload meshes in custom resource
groups if you don't want to (although preloading is often a good idea
anyway for performance).
      </li>






      <li> <b>Resource loading group fallback</b>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <ul>






          <li> When a resource is not found in the requested resource group, look for it in the others based on resource locations
          </li>






          <li> The group ownership of resources changes when this happens
          </li>






          <li> This allows you to load a material from a custom group and have it load textures into a general resource group dynamically
          </li>






        
        
        
        
        
        
        </ul>







      </li>






      <li> <b>ResourceGroupManager::unloadUnreferencedResourcesInGroup</b> now available to unload only resources which are not currently being used
      </li>






      <li> <b>ResourceManager::unloadUnreferencedResources</b> / <b>ResourceManager::reloadUnreferencedResources</b> now available to unload / reload only resources which are not currently being used
      </li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






</ul>







<ul>






  <li> <b>Platform Manager enhancements</b>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>






      <li> Added Ogre::PlatformManager::messagePump(RenderWindow*) to the
platform manager - This moves the Win32 message pump from Ogre::Root to
the Win32Platform Manager, and the GLX platform messages to the GLX
Platform manager. On other platforms (Mac &amp; SDL) this has no
effect. Call this method if not using startRendering (as startRendering
calls this everyloop for the default renderwindow) to pump messages
into Ogre while avoiding the OS pcific issues in your own code - allows
alt-tabbing, etc to work correctly.
      </li>






      <li> Timer stability on dual core systems
      </li>






      <li> GLX Platform only listens to Window X events when not using
Ogre input system - allows ability to plug in other input systems
easier, while not having to pump specific X events into Ogre manually.</li>






      <li> Added Viewport::setSkiesEnabled() to let users hide skies for
viewport individually, allow control skies displays or not more easy,
especially for using multiple viewports.</li>






    
    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>







  </li>






  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">D3D9 enhancements</span></li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>






    <li> Triple buffering enabled when vsync is enabled</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>






  <li style="font-weight: bold;">GL enhancements</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>






    <li> Two sided stencil is always supported for GL 2.0 compliant drivers, even ATI
    </li>






    <li> Fast texture-to-texture blit, blitFromMemory, and hardware
accelerated bi/trilinear scaling using FBO. This improves loading time
in the common case that some textures need to be scaled to power-of-two
size.
    </li>






    <li> Implement Texture::copyToTexture for GL, which was already
implemented for DX9 (useful for longer term storage of graphics
rendered to a texture)
    </li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>






  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Camera / Viewport Enhancements</span></li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>






    <li>Cameras &amp; Frustums can now have custom view and / or projection matrices if required
    </li>






    <li> Viewports now have a setting to say which buffers they clear if clearing is enabled (colour, depth, stencil)</li>






    <li>
Added off-axis perspective projection to Frustum and Camera.
Related functions: Frustum::setFrustumOffset,
Frustum::getFrustumOffset, Frustum::setFocalLength,
Frustum::getFocalLength.</li>






    <li> Added methods to access 'virtual' (reflected if need) or 'real' (unreflected always) world orientation/position of the camera.</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>






  <li> Added <b>radix sorting</b> routines to allow for faster sorting
  </li>






  <li> CEGUI renderer updated to v0.4.x
  </li>






  <li> Added IndexData::optimiseVertexCache to allow people to cache-optimise their triangle list indexes
  </li>






  <li> Added pulse width modulation option to WaveformControllerFunction
  </li>






  <li> Added Root::setFrameSmoothingPeriod() to let users customise smoothing of frame time fluctuations.
  </li>






  <li> Every render system config options are stored to configuration file.
  </li>






  <li> VC6 &amp; VC7.0 (2002) support discontinued; officially supported Microsoft compilers are now VC7.1 (2003) and VC8 (2005)
  </li>






  <li> Direct3D7 support removed</li>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v1.0.0 RC1
[Azathoth] (5 February
2005) - Major Release</p>











<p>1.0.0 is a big release, and due to us wanting to freeze
interfaces
at the best possible level for 1.0.0 there are more interface
breaking changes in 1.0.0 than is typical for previous releases. For
the full lowdown on upgrading your code from Hastur (0.15.x) to
Azathoth (1.0.x) , please see the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/AzathothNotes">Azathoth

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.15.0 [Hastur]
(23 October 2004) -
Major Release</p>











<p align="left">Note: Ogre development branches will now
have code
names; the 0.15 stable branch is known as 'Hastur', the continuing
development branch (which will be released as 1.0) is called
'Azathoth'. </p>











<p align="left">Enhancements:</p>











<ul>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Binary mesh format
enhanced. Previously the binary mesh format did not support all the
flexibility you could attain when you built meshes programmatically.
This has been addressed, and the mesh can now store arbitrary vertex
buffer formats, precomputed edge lists (for stencil shadows), and
tangent-space vectors (for normal mapping). You are strongly adviced to
use the OgreMeshUpgrade tool on all your meshes to uprade them to the
latest version, and choose 'y' when asked if you want to reorganise
your vertex buffers. The 'automatic' option is the quickest way to get
your meshes up to date, and you may find them slightly faster to render

as a result. <br>











Bear in mind that the .mesh size will increase because edge lists are
precomputed and stored by default - if you don't intend to use stencil
shadows then you can disable this with the '-e' parameter.</p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">OpenGL Shading Language
(GLSL) support. This means Ogre now supports programmable shaders
written in Cg, HLSL, GLSL and all variants of assembler (DirectX and
GL). </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Explicit Radian, Degree
and AngleUnit classes. To resolve ambiguity as to which angle unit is
being used, all methods which take an angle now take a Radian class.
You can pass Degree instances to this too and get automatic
degree-to-radian conversion. You can also use the AngleUnit class which
defaults to the current angle units (see Math). Note that conversions
are inlined and are thus very cheap; although if you want to avoid them
entirely, use Radian. This is an interface breaking change, so you will
need to update your code to use Radian(radianValue) or
Degree(degreeValue) where you are using basic types to store angles.</p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Reflection
enhancements. Automatic reflections using dynamic planes are now simple
to create using MovablePlane, and 'custom near clip planes' (oblique
depth projection) are available to allow you to clip reflected geometry
to an arbitrary plane without requiring additional hardware support
such as user clip planes. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Per-Renderable custom
parameters can now be mapped into vertex / fragment programs (using
ACT_CUSTOM) to better customise the look of your programmably shaded
objects</p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Skeletal animation
optimisation: by default it now uses an approximation of true
rotational interpolation which is slightly faster; true spherical
interpolation is still an option if more accuracy is required.</p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Edge list improvements;
Ogre can now deal with even more model construction variants while
still retaining stencil shadow integrity </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Billboard / particle
system index and vertex buffers are now deferred loading </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Blender and Milkshape

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Transparent materials
can now cast texture shadows, if an option is enabled in their material
(useful for alpha rejection textures) </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Added GLX platform manager, enabling the use of OGRE on
Linux without using SDL. This also has a nice configuration dialog
instead of the text based one. </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Ogre::String is no
longer a subclass of std::string, but a typedef to it. All extra
methods which were on Ogre::String are now on the Ogre::StringUtil
class. This is to resolve compatibility issues on some STLs; this is an
interface breaking change so you will need to update your code to use
the equivalent StringUtil methods.</p>

    <p>Patched the EdgeBuilder (calculates stencil shadow
structures) so that it detects when there are too many triangles
attached to a single edge, and reverts to not welding vertices across
vertex sets. This allow it to deal with multiple capped submeshes with
their own geometry (which are manifold in themselves) even if they
touch at the boundaries. At the same time it still deals with the case
where a model is only manifold when all submeshes are combined (it
tries to find this case first).</p>

        <p>Important: Those writing custom SceneManager
implementations will have to review the changes to the render queues
and render sequence when shadows are enabled, since supporting several
types of shadows has required these processes to be significantly
enhanced and decomposed into multiple parts (which should lend
themselves to customisation in your SMs if you need them). In
particular, note that the signature of
SceneManager::_findVisibleObjects has changed so if you override this
you will need to alter yours too - the compiler will not tell you about
this!</p>

purpose projective texturing</b>. Projective texturing was
possible in Ogre before, but it required you to manually set up the

sync the projection of the texture with changes to the frustum. </p>

instances</b>. The sharing of skeletons between multiple animated

hook up external effects on the bones on particular instances of that
skeleton (in entities); applications such as manually controlling bones

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Support for vertex
and fragment programs (shaders), including: </p>











        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <ul>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Low-level
assembler programs under D3D9 (vs_1_1, vs_2_x, ps_1_x, ps_2_x) and GL
(NV_texture_shader, NV_register_combiners, arbvp1, arbfp1,
ATI_fragment_shader) </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">High-level
program support via plugins, so far we support Cg and D3D9 HLSL. Cg
compiles down to D3D and GL assembler, and includes converters to
non-assembler formats including NV_register_combiners and
ATI_fragment_shader so you can write a single program for all targets. </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Programs can be
defined and reused many times with different parameters, all through
.material scripts </p>











          </li>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Materials now
support multiple 'techniques', which can be used as automatic fallbacks
for older cards which don't support the requisite features for your
preferred shading approach</p>











      </li>











      <li>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Material LOD - you
can tell materials to change technique over distance to save rendering
power on distant objects; this is subject to the same control
parameters (camera bias and entity bias) that is used for mesh LOD so
you can tweak it heavily </p>











      </li>











      <li>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Scriptable
multipass rendering; you can now specify multiple passes in one
material if you wish, and those passes can also be iterated once per
light automatically, and the engine will call the pass with each nearby
light </p>











      </li>











      <li>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The .material
script format has been extensively upgraded to handle all these new
options; however if you have 0.12.x or previous scripts you can
automatically update them using the OgreMaterialUpgrade tool </p>











      </li>

  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Light
management upgraded</b>; you can now have an unlimited number of
lights in the scene, and OGRE will pick and use the 'n' closest lights
('n' is configurable per pass in the material scripts) which are within
their attenuation range when rendering an object. This makes light
management much more practical, especially when using vertex and
fragment programs. As mentioned above, passes can even be configured to
iterate using the 'n' nearest lights. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>More texture
formats supported</b>: we now support 1D textures, compressed
textures (DXT formats), volume textures (true 3D textures, not just 6
faces like cube maps), and loading all of the above from the .dds
format, even in GL. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>XCode </b>IDE
support on Mac OSX</p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Precompiled header
support on VC6 and VC7, this makes compilation a lot faster. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Updated 3DS and Maya
exporters</p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Frame events can now be
raised externally, which makes it easier to update the internal state
of particle systems, controllers et al when you're running your own
rendering loop instead of using Root::startRendering. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Texture filtering can
now be controlled more finely by optionally setting the min, mag an mip
filter instead of one abstracted filter type.</p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Fonts now look cleaner,
texture size has been optimised and filtering tuned </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>The 'v' texture coordinate has been flipped so that the
origin is now in the top-left, this removes the need to flip textures
and improves loading times as well as making compressed texture support
feasible. The .mesh format will be converted on the fly automatically,
but you should use OgreMeshUpgrade to fix it permanently </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Complete overhaul of
core geometry usage resulting in optimised use of hardware vertex and
index buffers, providing significant speed boosts on all cards,
typically of between 50 and 200% depending on the application. ATI
9500+ cards on DirectX9 will see particularly large increases (often
five-fold) due to their particular affinity to this approach. </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Geometry structures
redesigned to support the above and also to provide the basis for
vertex and pixel shaders. This will not affect you unless you
manipulated geometry structures such as the old GeometryData directly -
those who did <a href="vbo-update/index.html">should read
about the details of the changes</a>. </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Transparent materials
no longer assume that depth writing needs to be off, this setting was
causing some problems with those using alpha blending. Those of you
using transparent materials which do need depth writing to be turned
off will need to set it in your material scripts </p>

<p class="mainheader" align="left">v0.11.0 (18 June
2003)</p>











<p align="left">Changes since 0.10.0:</p>











<ul>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">SceneQuery introduced;
a generic way to query the SceneManager database of objects and world
geometry in a way which is optimised per scene management technique but
transparent for the client application. Currently only
IntersectionSceneQuery is implemented but RaySceneQuery,
SphereSceneQuery and others will soon be available too </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">ReferenceApplication
introduced; this is a new library which sits on top of the main OGRE
library in order to provide a reference implementation of combining
OGRE with other libraries for use in a full application. Currently
combines OGRE and ODE to provide an easy to use collision and realistic
physics system, utilising the new SceneQuery functions for generic
collision detection. Object to object collision is currently supported,
together this object to world collision for the BspSceneManager (ie
collision against Quake3 levels), see the BspCollision demo for an
example. Per-object friction, bounciness and mass parameters are all
definable, also most of the ODE joint types ie ball, hinge, hinge2,
universal. World collision for the terrain managers will be added
shortly. </p>

  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Material scripts. All
materials can now be specified in .material files, which are loaded at
startup and can be altered without recompiling your application. Tweak
to your hearts content! See the material scripting section in the
Tutorials for more information. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Landscape rendering - a
ROAM scene manager example implementation is now included in the
distribution, together with an example demo. Whilst the ROAM approach
will not be developed further due to it's relatively high CPU overhead,
it serves as an example of how vastly different scene managers can be
plugged into Ogre. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Billboarding.
Billboards can now be used to create special effects. Particle systems
using this facility are under development. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Better culling on the
standard scene manager. The standard non-scene-specific scene manager
now hierarchically culls movables based on their bounding boxes. A
triangle counter monitors culling performance. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Refactored the methods
called in the main rendering loop in SceneManager to allow subclasses
to modify the behaviour more easily without having to duplicate code. </p>











  </li>











  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Better compliance with STL standards. Ogre is now built
using <a href="http://www.stlport.org/">STLport</a>
on both Windows and Linux, and this has necessitated a closer fit with
the STL standard rather than the Microsoft implementation. </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Some cosmetic changes
to the way plug-ins are loaded - no need to specify the extension of
the plug-in anymore, and it is registered as given in the Plugins.cfg

PluginName </p>

</ul>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">6 January 2002</p>











<p align="left">Most bugs in shader parsing sorted out. A
few shader
effects are not supported yet, but most are there and look good.
Texture coordinate modifications are missing for the moment, but
environment mapping is in (albeit a little different from Q3A's
method - I chose to use cameraspace reflection vectors to produce the
effect because these are hardware accelerable, whilst Q3A's method of
using the vector from camera location to vertex is not), as are all
the shafts of light, animated flames etc.</p>











<p align="left">No MD3 models are being rendered so there
are a few
blank spots in the level where a gargoyle, wall sconce etc should be.
I'm not going to implement this for now, I've proved the point I
wanted to prove which is that Ogre can handle this type of scene
well. It's just a few Q3-specific details which are missing which is
no big deal, I never set out to produce a working copy of Q3A.</p>











<p align="left">I will be releasing another snapshot based
on this
codebase, and also will release binary demos of all the examples.</p>











<p align="left">Next: texture coordinate modifications,
extensions to
the controller classes. Then particle systems. </p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">5 January 2002</p>











<p align="left">Skydomes and skyboxes are in and working,
giving you 3
types of sky to play with. Skyboxes are for static, wrap-around
environment textures like space, whilst skydomes are like skyplanes,
but curved.</p>











<p align="left">Quake3 shader script conversion is going
well, Ogre
loads in the .shader files and converts them to Material objects as
required, meaning that you can now see flames, shafts of light, TV
screens etc inside Ogre. Animated textures are being loaded but not
animated yet - I'm going to try and get animation working within a
nice generic OO controller framework if I can rather than bash out a
single-use approach.</p>











<p align="left">One thing I've noticed now the sky is
being displayed
is there are 'sparklies' around the curved surfaces visible mostly
when there is a light-coloured sky. Damn. It appears the points
generated from the bezier patches don't quite match up with the
surrounding static geometry, meaning there are small gaps. This is a
TODO.</p>











<p align="left">I still need to fix the odd crash point
and a few
shaders aren't being loaded properly. Also environment mapping needs
a bit of work since Quake3 bases them on camera position -&gt;
vertex
rather than camera eye vector -&gt; normal, which means they look
wrong. I should alos render the 'models' in the level i.e. geometry
that doesn't have lightmaps like gargoyles.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">27 December 2001</p>











<p align="left">Skyplanes are now working. You can now
create a plane
which is at contant distance from the camera at and orientation for
use as a sky. I'll be moving on to skyboxes imminently which will
allow full wrap-around skies.</p>











<p align="left">I have also totally revamped the example
code that is
included with the engine. Instead of the single TestApp project,
there is now an Examples folder with multiple projects under this
which demo each effect. I have also created an object-oriented
framework for the examples too, meaning they are now a lot better
structured and hopefully better to understand.</p>











<p align="left">I also intend to release some binary demos
soon so
people can quickly see what the engine is capable of without having
to build from the source. The good news this week is that I just did
a Release build of the Quake3 level renderer, and it runs at a very
sweet 170fps in windowed mode on my Athlon 1Ghz and GeForce 2. In
fullscreen mode at 1024x768 at 32-bit colour it still manages between
50 and 80 fps. I'm very pleased indeed. I would like to tidy up some
of the missing textures before I do a binary release so I'll be
sorting out the skybox support and other texture effects first.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">24 December 2001</p>











<p align="left">Refactored the entity rendering routines
in the base
SceneManager class to make them easier to reuse in subclasses.</p>











<p align="left">Material class enhanced to contain all the
other render
settings such as depth buffer parameters, culling modes, texture
filtering etc. It is now possible to drive all the rendering settings
via the Material class now so that no calls are required to the
RenderSystem class. This makes the settings more intuitive to use,
and ensures that you can have different settings per object if you
want by assigning different materials, and the SceneManager controls
the changes to the rendering settings.</p>











<p align="left">Major rewrite of SceneManager::setMaterial
and added
RenderSystem::_setTextureUnitSettings (used by the former) so that
only <b>changes</b> to the material settings are sent to
the
RenderSystem. This ensures that rendering state changes are minimised
and that custom settings are reset only when required. This has
improved the framerate across the board by about 50%. A further
optimisation which is still to be made is ordering the materials in
the render sequence to minimise the render state changes still
further, e.g. scheduling 2 materials that have the same layer 0
texture but different layer 1 textures next to each other.</p>











<p align="left">Started adding sky plane and sky box
support to the
SceneManager class, but this is not yet functional.</p>











<p align="left">Merry Xmas!</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">4 December 2001</p>











<p align="left">General Bezier Patch support through the
PatchSurface
class.</p>











<p align="left">Quake3 level loading uses curved surface
support to
display Q3A's bezier curves. Custom shader scripts still to be done.</p>











<p align="left">IMPORTANT: To compile &amp; run the
TestApp demo
application you will need to change line 414 of WinMainTest.cpp to
point at your Quake3Arena pak0.pk3, since I can't distribute Q3A
levels and textures for size and copyright reasons.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">11 November 2001</p>











<p>First Quake3 level rendering release. No support for shader
scripts or curved surfaces yet. </p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">12 October 2001</p>











<p>Modified the material blending routines to make it more
reliable
to fall back on multipass rendering whilst preserving all the correct
effects. To do this I had to simplify the basic multitexture blending
operations which automatically fall back to multipass, and require
that the application explicitly specifies a fallback blend multipass
operation if it chooses to use the more complex blending modes which
are only available under multitexture hardware. I hope by doing this
I keep it simple for most cases (people normally use jusy ADD,
MODULATE, REPLACE or ALPHABLEND anyway) whilst still allowing
complete flexibility for those who like to tinker with the obscure
modes.</p>











<p>Decided to make another point release even without the
finished
Quake3 stuff because there's so much that's useful.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">9 October 2001</p>











<p>Object/scene blending operations (as opposed to multiple
texture
layer blending on the same object) support has been added, allowing
new effects like transparency.</p>











<p>I keep getting distracted from my Quake3 level work but I am
progressing - the reason why I switched to this subject is that I
realised my fallback technique to multipass rendering when not enough
multitexturing hardware was available was not correct, and in order
to be able to fix it I needed these new blending options. I'm now
wondering whether to fix the multipass fallback now I have the tools
or to leave it until later. Right now, if you use more texture layers
than the hardware supports in a single pass, things won't look right.
I'll get to it.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">6 October 2001</p>











<p>Ok, remember the problem from 16 September re texture
coordinates
and confusion over whether (0,0) was the top or bottom left corner of
the texture? Well it turns out that once again Direct3D is the odd
one out, and 3DS is actually using the more common convention, i.e.
(0,0) is the <i>bottom</i> left corner. I have therefore
changed the
3ds2oof routine <i>back</i> to how it was before (using
3DS UV
corrdinates directly) and am flipping the texture itself in the
Y-axis when loading it in the Direct3D texture implementation to
compensate (D3DTexture.cpp). I should have checked more thoroughly
before changing things to be in line with D3D, I should have known it
would probably be the odd one.</p>











<p>I've done this because I want Ogre to follow industry
standards
(e.g. right-handed coordinates, anticlockwise vertex winding) rather
than Direct3D's viewpoint which is usually the opposite, even though
it's Direct3D I'm working on at the moment. I do this because it's
what everybody will be used to when they come from maths texts or
modelling tools, and is the same as the OpenGL approach (so the
OpenGL port should be easier than Direct3D). I just compensate inside
my Direct3D-specific classes (e.g. by flipping the Z axis, changing
the culling mode, or flipping the texture as above).</p>

<p>Progressive updates are being made to the OgreEngineIndoor
module
in CVS. Quake3 levels are being loaded and coversion is in progress.</p>











<p>I have also fixed a couple more bugs: the ColourValue class
was
implementing colours a little too bright and wrapped around to black
when pure white was specified. This has been fixed. In addition, the
mipmap generation was not generating enough mipmaps under Direct3D
because D3DX ignores requests for the number of mipmaps and generates
as many as required to reduce to a 1x1 texture. This caused smaller
mipmaps to be black and thus textures would wink out at long
distances. This has been fixed.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">16 September 2001</p>











<p>Slow going due to moving house. However, fixed a problem with
texture coordinates as converted from 3DS using 3ds2oof - I just
realised that 3DS uses UV coordinates where V=0.0 is at the <i>bottom</i>
of the texture map, instead of the top as with everything else! That
explains the strange textures on some models. Fixed 3ds2oof to make
V=(1.0 - V) during the conversion. Reconvert your models!</p>

<p>Ogre now supports loading of resources from more flexible
locations, including compressed archives (.zip and Quake3 .pk3
files). You can specify a list of search paths and archives which are
either general across the whole of Ogre or specific to a resource
type (e.g. textures, meshes).</p>











<p>I've also added support for loading TGA images as well, since
Quake3 maps use them in places. </p>











<p>I have also dropped support for BMP files. This is because I
have
had to implement memory-based versions of the image decoders to
support loading from archives, and to be frank I couldn't be bothered
to implement one for BMP since it's a naff format in my opinion and
tied to the Windows platform anyway. Ogre supports JPEG, PNG and TGA
which should be plenty of flexibility. Personally I think when you've
got PNG (for lossless) and JPEG (for lossy), you don't need anything
else.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">10 August 2001</p>











<p>Texture blending is now in and working! The new TestApp
demonstrates the functionality by loading a base model with a
standard texture, then adding a second texture layer and applying an
environment map to it. The keys 0-7 change the texture blending mode
to show what effects different parameters have.</p>











<p>I'm now moving onto other features; I want to look at Quake3
file
loading - there are a couple of things nagging me about managing
materials and entities that I'd like to look at but I'd really like
to get started on Q3A bsp files now. I also wanted to work on
animation, both within models (skeletal animation &amp; bones) and
for paths of objects (bezier curves &amp; bsplines), but I just
don't
have time to do everything I want to! Q3A files first.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">5 August 2001</p>











<p>Back from a break for holidays!</p>











<p>The Camera class now allows a SceneNode to override it's
position
and orientation when the Camera is attached to a SceneNode. This will
allow cameras attached to world objects etc.</p>











<p>Started implementing the texture blending operations - the
interface is complete, I'm now moving onto the Direct3D
implementation. For the moment I'm not worrying about minimising the
number of times that changes to blending parameters are made during a
frame - I'm still concentrating on minimising the texture changes,
which is the main overhead anyway. More optimisation will likely come
along with new SceneManager subclasses.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">21 July 2001</p>











<p>The Camera class now uses quaternions too. Camera rotation is
a
lot more concise now (instead of storing &amp; trying to update 3
vectors I just have a single quaternion) and is more predictable and
hopefully more flexible for the future.&nbsp;</p>











<p>You can attach a Camera to a SceneNode (this is meant for use
in
having cameras tracking other objects in the world) but I have yet to
implement this - I intend now that they're both on the same basis
that if you choose to attach a camera to a scene node then the
SceneNode overrides the camera's own position and direction, and
maybe even that they update each other (so telling a camera to look
somewhere would update the orientation of it's SceneNode too).</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">19 July 2001</p>











<p>Updated SceneNode class to use quaternions internally for all
orientations / rotations. This should both be faster and give me more
flexibility for the future. Also added a lot more manipulation
routines the SceneNode class which were sorely lacking before if you
wanted to move stuff around. The Camera class still uses matrices
internally but I intend to change that so that a Camera depends on
the SceneNode it is attached to for positioning rather than doing it
itself. To this end I will need to add extra features to the
SceneNode class to replicate functions like lookAt(), which is ok
since this will be handy for pointing other objects at each other
too.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">17 July 2001</p>











<p>Fixed an issue with the 3ds2oof utility - it now generates
vertex
normals based on smooth groups rather than just averaging based on
the faces which use the vertex. This removes artefacts along model
'seams' e.g. the point where a texture wraps around on the model.</p>











<p>Reimplemented environment mapping using the new
Material::TextureLayer structure. Started work on adding more
manipulation features to the SceneNode class (body code still to do).</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">4 July 2001</p>











<p>Python now has full access to the engine, and it's working
great.
I've also enabled callbacks into Python from the engine, so you can
register a Python class as a listener for frame update events so C++
calls Python every frame. Nice.</p>











<p>Future Python developments include an embedded version of
Python
in Ogre so you can build a compiled application which still used
interpreted scripts for some things - this will be useful for level
scripting etc where the script can be kept in the level data. For now
though I'm going back to developing the core engine features .</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">20 June 2001</p>











<p>Spending an awful lot of time exposing all the necessary
objects
and their interfaces to Python (up till now I have it working but
only a few interfaces were exposed). About 90% there now, with a few
issues to iron out - I had to extend the compiler heap limit to get
it to compile so far since the heavy usage of templates puts a great
strain on the compiler memory usage. In a few days I should be in a
position to do all my engine testing through Python as well as
through a custom C++ application (currently TestApp). </p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">13 June 2001</p>











<p>Added FrameListener and FrameEvent classes in order to
represent
the frame update callback functions in a more object-oriented way.
User applications now extend FrameListener and register their
interest in receiving frame events - this is based on the Java model
of event listening. Note that a boon of this method is that Boost
Python allows you to extend existing C++ classes so this provides a
perfect mechanism to have C++ call Python scripts when events occur. </p>











<p>I intend to extend this pattern to other events like
collisions
when I implement them. </p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">10 June 2001</p>











<p align="left">Changed from using SWIG to Boost Python
for Python
script integration. I changed because Boost Python supports C++
features much beter (including catching C++ exceptions and turning
them into Python exceptions, support for namespaces and overloaded
operators), it integrates better with my build cycle (doesn't require
a separate generate from interface files and can be built directly
into the library), and is more up-to-date with the latest Python
libraries. I was finding that SWIG's emphasis on pure C as opposed to
C++ was getting in the way, and Boost has definitely addressed this.</p>











<p align="left">Introduced PythonLink class to expose
classes to
Python.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">7 June 2001</p>











<p align="left">Implemented Python integration using SWIG
(Simplified
Wrapper and Interface Generator). You can now start and initialise
Ogre from a Python console and drive it interactively. More work
required to expose the full interface to Python however.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">31 May 2001</p>











<p align="left">Cut over to CVS - CVS repository is now up
and running
at SourceForge.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">20 May 2001</p>











<p align="left">SceneNode class integrated with Entity /
SubEntity
classes. Working basic scene graph. Also reimplemented my previous
hack using DirectInput as a proper platform-specific user input class
- added the OgreUtility module for this purpose.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">15 May 2001</p>











<p align="left">SubEntity implementation complete,
together with
customisable Materials at the SubEntity level. Material usage by
SubEntities is now indexed by the SceneManager so that rendering can
be grouped by Material such that as few as possible render state
changes take place. Note that this does not currently deal with
transparency.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">13 May 2001</p>











<p align="left">Bugs with the new Mesh loading routines
now ironed out.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">24 April 2001</p>











<p align="left">Implemented Mesh, SubMesh and MeshManager
classes for
loading Ogre Object Format files (converted from .3ds using the Ogre
3ds2oof tool). Decided to allow the original 3ds mesh to be broken
down into chunks specific per material or grouped as a whole
depending on requirements. The 3ds2oof utility makes a goos guess as
to what is best, based on the percentage of the vertices each SubMesh
uses out of the whole model - the lower the percentage the greater
chance it will have a dedicated vertex list rather than sharing the
whole since that saves sending unnecessary vertices to the pipeline.
However this can be customised with parameters since you may want to
use vertex buffers where it's more efficient to store 1 buffer even
if you only use parts of it.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">1 April 2001</p>











<p align="left">Began overhaul of Mesh loading routines.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">30 March 2001</p>











<p align="left">Switched to Doxygen for document
generation since ccdoc
still doesn't support namespaces. Doxygen is better at
cross-referencing anyway and draws nice diagrams.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">24 March 2001</p>











<p align="left">Added JPEG loading support, and moved this
and existing
image loading code (PNG) into the Image class. BMP loading is still
supported but only on Windows platforms so this is still residing in
the D3DTexture class as a special case.</p>











<p align="left">Improved the handling of non-square
textures on
hardware that supports only square textures. The image is now
stretched into the square area so that the relative texture
coordinates are still valid and no black bands appear on the model.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">23 March 2001</p>











<p align="left">Multiple viewports per window is
implemented and
working Ok. Z-Order also applies so picture-in-picture views are
possible by placing a smaller viewport on top of another larger one.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">11 March 2001</p>











<p align="left">Changed the default mechanism for
supplying vertex
components (position, normals, texture coords, colours) to the
RenderOperation class. They were previously assumed to be part of the
same buffer with flags indicating which were present. However this
was too restrictive and prevented you using entirely separate memory
areas for different components, and adding extra components to
vertices on the fly. </p>











<p align="left">Instead the RenderOperation class now
takes pointers
for each component, and a 'span' value determines the gap between
each value. This allows you to use separate buffers if you like, but
also use a combined buffer if that suits you (by using the 'span'
value to skip over values in between).</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">6 March 2001</p>











<p align="left">Implemented a 3DStudio conversion tool
that works
directly from the .3DS files rather than from ASCII exports (as
previously) or from a MAX plugin as some others do, which requires a
3DS license. I based my code on an existing open source routine but I
have exteded it since it had a few shortcomings. The tool is called
'3ds2oof' because it converts 3DS files to a proprietary format, .OOF
(Ogre Object File). This is because it's more efficient for me to do
extra processing at conversion time like calculating bounding boxes,
splitting vertex buffers, strippifying etc (not that I'm doing all
this yet, but I <i>can</i>) rather than at load time as I
would have
to do if I loaded direct from 3DS inside Ogre.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">1 March 2001</p>











<p align="left">Over the last 2 weeks I reimplemented my
interface to
the DirectX rendering pipeline in the new Ogre structure, under the
D3DRenderSystem class. Rendering requests are now packaged up in the
RenderOperation class, giving me more flexibility on how rendering
requests are submitted and handled. Now all the support classes (mesh
loading, scene management) are needed.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">11 February 2001</p>











<p align="left">I've been picking apart the platform
dependencies in
Ogre so it'll be more portable. I'm also making it flexible enough to
handle any number of rendering windows and viewports within thse
windows, and also giving you the choice of an automatic rendering
loop (max frame rate) and a render-on-demand interface much like you
would need for an application like a modelling tool where you want to
free up cycles when things don't move and frae rate isn't the most
important thing.</p>











<p align="left">I now have a nice hierarchy crossing the
OgreEngine and
OgreWin32Platform modules, with functionality broken down into
RenderTarget, RenderWindow and Win32RenderWindow classes. Other
platforms can be implemented later, just replacing the
Win32RenderWindow maybe with XRenderWindow or MacRenderWindow.</p>











<p class="mainheader" align="left">29 December 2000</p>











<p align="left">Ogre development starts again after almost
a year's
break while I finished my degree. Lots of research and design work at
this stage to work out how I should structure the object model.</p>
